NOTE: THE CLASSES AND XPATH MAY HAVE CHANGED WHEN YOU ARE READING THIS, SO FIND YOUR CLASS NAME FOR THE TYPING BOX AND THEN USE IT. Again we will make the program sleep for 20 seconds. Then we will use the second element from the list for sending the message and will use keys. ENTER to send the message using Keys that we have imported earlier. We will use try and except because sometimes it is not able to access the element and will throw the Indexerror. And if it happens, we will try it again and then send it using its ‘Xpath’. After that, we will make our program sleep, as if it is sent from our program but due to instant use of quit method to quit the driver, it may not send it sometimes. "

#"And if any error happens in sending, then it will simply send the user a notification. For that, we have to use notify function of the imported notification from the plyer module. As we have done in infinite timer using python, we will send the desktop notification to the user. To know more about what is done here, just refer to another article which is infinite timer using python. At the last of the error happened, we will just quit the program as we don’t need to do any work now. So we will use the _exit(0) function of the os module with ‘0’ to say everything is fine in the program to the system.Now we have to work only on the database section."
